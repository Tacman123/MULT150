// Hello, I've decided to change the footsteps sounds with a water splashing sound to make the movement noise make sense.
// I have also decided to add multiple chaos balls to add extra obstacles, enlarged them to cause further challenge, and proceeded to add super bouncy materials to cause more speed as they hit other balls.
// I have also made the player bumpers into three seperate blocks with gaps to make things just slightly harder.
// I have also given the each chaos ball it's own tag with a corresponding goal. All the same color to add to the "chaos"
// I have made an attempt to create a game timer script. Though I believe it will work. I did not have time to implement it.
