/* This game was not that difficult and is actually quit fair.
 * The speed at which everything runs towards you is actually quite well put together
 * The speed of the player strafing is very well balanced. 
 * The game is so balanced that I forget I even have the :Phase Out" ability
 * If I were to make the game more difficult, I would change the speed of the obstacle hit penalty. The speed should be sped up not slowed.
 * Slowing down the world also effects the slowing of the in-game timer as well.
 * If the player was sped up yes time powerups would fly at the player but so will the obstacles.
 * In order to counter the speed, I would make the player phase for a temporary amount of time.
 * THe wow factor I would like to add would be to lean into the "Android" main character and the dystopian cyperpunk look to the environment. 
 * I've gone ahead and changed the obstacles to some robots running towards the player.
 * I think those changes add to the "Wow" factor of the game.
 * The game's challenge of trying to go as long as you can while continuing to dodge obstacles is a testament to games like Temple Run. The aeshthetic of the game is very pleasing as well.
 * The game is only tedious in the regards of the character feeling they are running slow while everything else speeds past
 * It also is feels kind of bad when you need an upgrade or try to grab an powerup but obstacles spawn practically on top of them.
 * The obstacles were changed to a robot with a running animation. They had a directional issue, but I've went ahead and fixed that by changing the local rotation of the both the robot and power ups and changing the code to positive movement speed.
 * The powerup mesh was changed and to a cube and enlarged, with clock hands added to it to give the look of a squared clock.
 * The material was also changed to a white slightly transparent color.
 * I then also changed the particle system a slightly lengthened particles with a a skinny ribbon to make it look important and like a powerup. */
